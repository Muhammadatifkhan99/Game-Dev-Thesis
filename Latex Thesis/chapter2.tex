\subsection{Co-op Fun} Teaming up with friends to tackle infestations could foster teamwork and communica-tion, making Exterminator a fun and social experience.

\section{Detail Feasibility Report}
Below is a detail feasibility report for Proximity Assault.
\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
The technical requirements for this project are a system that can support the game engine which in this case will be Unity, Unity requires a subscription but this project will be using the student plan, in which the team can use all the features for free. Unity works with C\# which is a similar to C++. As a C++ Programmer we have a very good understanding of the concepts in C++ which we can easily apply to this scenario. The IDE the project will be coded with is Visual Studio Community which have a built in compiler with it.
The development will also requires advance features like complex AI or detail environment, which will requires additional learning resources.\\
The problems faced by implementing the system will requires an expertise in testing for which the system must be tested by a person from out of the team, as the a solo developer we will have to manage the time and available resources with great efficiency in order to complete all the phases of the project.
The system will probably take months to be completed because it requires the process of learning along with development of the system. The team will try the best to complete it as soon as possible.

\subsection{Economic Feasibility}
The team will purchase some courses from Udemy in order to achieve their objective in faster and efficient way.
The team will use assets which are probably free or low cost but once the testing is done the team will invest in the purchasing of assets but if there was sufficient time most of the assets will be developed for the system by the team which at some stage of development will include a designers and testers.
The global video game market has reached staggering levels of profitability. In 2023, the global video game market was estimated at over \$200 billion, with mobile gaming being the largest contributor, accounting for more than 50\% of the market's revenue \cite{newzoo2023}.

\subsection{Social Feasibility}

The most important of the social feasibility is the ethical considerations in the game, as discussed be-fore the game aims to highlight a point to the nation which is responsibility; You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed \cite{saint_exupery_little_1943}.
The system will be designed in such a way that no culture, race, age or gender is targeted. The team will design strategies in order to remove anything that could lead to the discrimination of any particular group, Instead the game target audience globally.
The development of the game will be an educational asset for other students, developers and anyone who wants to start with game development but requires a clear road map for them. All the resources, documentation and any assets that are required for redesigning of the game will be available to the everyone from around the globe.
The last point is basically highlighted to give the project and educational value.
