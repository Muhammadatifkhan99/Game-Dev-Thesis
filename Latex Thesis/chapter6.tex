\section{Deployment Diagram}

The deployment diagram illustrates the architecture of the Proximity Assault for Android and iOS platforms. The game application includes essential features such as a local inventory system, an in-game AI system, a dummy shop system, and two levels that are stored locally on the device. Future enhancements include the integration of an external server for the shop system to facilitate transactions and Firebase for tracking user data and analytic. Currently, the game does not have cloud-based features or multiplayer support, as depicted in the diagram.\\
