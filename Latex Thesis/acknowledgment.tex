I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Dr. Sara, my supervisor and professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Peshawar, for her invaluable guidance and support throughout this project. Her teachings in Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Analysis and Design during my bachelor's have been fundamental to the development of this project.

I extend my heartfelt thanks to my family, especially my late father, mother, and elder brother. My father laid a strong foundation for my education, creating an environment filled with encouragement and exposure that shaped my journey. After his passing, my mother and brother provided unwavering support, ensuring that I could continue my education and pursue my goals.

My experience at Crescent Cyber significantly enriched my understanding and skills, providing me with practical insights that enhanced this project.

I am immensely grateful to GitHub, Microsoft, JetBrains, and Unity for their tools and services, which made the development process smoother and more efficient. Additionally, I would like to thank HEC for awarding me the scholarship that made my bachelor's degree possible.

I owe special thanks to my professors: Dr. Asim Jalal, Malik Abdul Haseeb, Dr. Ibrar Ahmad, and Dr. Qazi Ejaz Ali Shah, whose exceptional teaching has been instrumental in shaping me into the person and student I am today. Their guidance and knowledge left a lasting impact on me during my time at the department.
